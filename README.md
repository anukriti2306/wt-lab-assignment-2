XAMPP Instructions:
Start XAMPP: Open your XAMPP Control Panel and click "Start" next to Apache.

Find htdocs: Find your XAMPP installation folder. Inside it, find the folder named htdocs. (This is usually at C:\xampp\htdocs).

Create a Folder: Inside htdocs, create a new folder for your project. Let's call it lab_project.

Save Your Files: Save both registration_form.html (the new one) and process.php inside this new lab_project folder.

Open in Browser: Open Chrome (or any browser) and go to this URL:

http://localhost/lab_project/registration_form.html

Now, when you fill out the form and click "Register Now," the jQuery will check if the fields are filled, and if they are, it will send the data to process.php, which will run and display your formatted results. This should be exactly what your lab requires!
